<p>The last few years we have been to cockfields farm.i have put together a list of places where you and your family can pick your own pumpkin in or around the greater manchester area. I’ve picked ones suitable for all ages as i know most of you have young children. Find what to do today, this weekend, or in december. Halloween in the city traditionally lights up some of the city centre’s most iconic buildings in gory green. It’ll feel almost just like halloween in days past, and you might find it such an easy way to hand out candy that you keep doing this years after this pandemic is a distant memory.</p>
