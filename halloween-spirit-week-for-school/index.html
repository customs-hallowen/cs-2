<p>5…one more makes 6….” our halloween math story problem this friend dressed up as marshall we made a tower taller than the orange of our pumpkins we measured how tall our pumpkins are with our cubes 4 +1 = 5 pumpkins!!! Let’s get into the halloween spirit! It is a special week where students who attend school show their school and team spirit by dressing up in line with the days’ themes. See the icon on the left for details. I always loved spirit week at school, the opportunity to dress up in fun ways, to be silly and creative beyond my usual “school clothes.” and again, it was one of the things i was so excited about when max started kindergarten.</p>
