The creepy towering clown, also known as the towering creepy clown, or grimsli the great, is an animatronic sold by spirit halloween for the 2017, 2018, and 2019 halloween seasons.

Yesterday, they gave us two new animatronics with miserable marie and punctured pete, and today they’re giving us an early look at three with fright in the box, clowning around, and johnny punk.
