<p>The movie is notable for the return of original final girl, jamie lee. Halloween is an american feature film of the slasher horror genre. With jamie lee curtis, judy greer, andi matichak, james jude courtney. It stars jamie lee curtis and nick castle who reprise their respective roles as laurie strode and michael.

If one were to assemble a mount rushmore of horror villains, a good case could be made that michael myers should be on it.</p>
